Classification Model of Heart Stroke database

The proposed model predicts heart stroke by exploring the  classification algorithm KNN and does
performance analysis. The objective of this model is to effectively predict if the patient suffers from heart stroke. The health
professional enters the input values from the patient's health report. The data is fed into model which predicts the probability of
having heart stroke.


Dataset Overview:

The dataset was taken from kaggle and contains details of an avegage person.

The dataset was clean and standardized for easy implementaion.


Analysis:

People having comparatively higher glucose level and slighltly higher BMI have suffered from heart stroke.

People having higher glucose level and older age are more prone to having a heart stroke.
